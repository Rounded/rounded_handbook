                <p>We wanted to contribute to the industry but there weren't many places in Syracuse with colorful walls, whiskey Friday's, and ping-pong tournaments, so we started Rounded. Over the last two years, the complexity of our clientele and ambition has evolved.</p>

                <p>Now, with 15 full-time, we play in both advanced consumer and enterprise application development -- native apps to web applications. We like to work with companies who demonstrate an appreciation for the value design brings to software. And, most importantly, Rounded is best described as part agency and part laboratory. We work with clients to build relationships, improve our craft, and expand our runway to experiment.</p>

          <p>Illustrations are a great way to communicate a message while continuing to carry through the aesthetic and style of the Rounded brand. Use the Rounded color pallet as a base for all of your illustrations. Naturally, you'll need to use different shades and hues in order to properly convey an image or scene, but be sure that it is consistent with the base pallet.</p>

          <h3>Finding Your Rounded Path</h3>
          <p class="question"><b>Q:</b> <i>Where do I begin?</i></p>

          <p class="answer">You've made it. Congratulations! Now it's time for you to get to know everyone in the office. There are no formal or forced "icebreakers". Just get your toes wet. If you're shy, don't be. Come out for drinks, grab a coffee, or challenge one of your fellow employees to a game of ping pong. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask. Remember we've brought you on because we think you're a good fit. So be yourself!</p>
        
          <p><b>Quick tips:</b></p>
          <p><ul>
            <li>Take a tour of the Tech Garden - (bathroom, common area, sandbox, kitchen, etc). You'll be given an access card to the Tech Garden, which can be entered from the front door on Warren Street and the side door on Harrison Street. If you're full-time employee, you'll be granted a parking spot kitty corner to the Tech Garden.</li>

            <li>Ping pong - We're always up for a challenge.</li>

            <li>Software - Register for all of our software and get a tutorial from an employee (tools will be discussed later).</li>

            <li>Swag - Grab a Rounded t-shirt and pick up your business cards.</li>

            <li>Kitchen - Get a tutorial on the 12 coffee spitters we have.</li>

            <li>Desk - Grab yourself a desk, and make yourself comfy.  We have an open office space to facilitate communication.</li>

            <li>Parking - The best option for parking is kitty corner to The Technology Garden.</li>

            <li>Rounded Presents - Attend a monthly Rounded Presents, featuring a dynamic speaker who is passionate and knowledgeable about a particular topic.</li>

            <li>Team dinners - In the mood for an amazing Japanese dinner with some soki? Attend our frequent team dinners and barbecues.</li>

            <li>Cafe Kubal - Head over to Kubal with the team for lunch or a coffee.</li>

            <li>Restaurants - Empire (grab a beer), The Mission (get the chicken hard tacos), Pastabilities (Buffet style - try the linguine with hot tom and two meatballs), Dinosaur BBQ (a Syracuse staple), Otro Cinco (Spanish and Mexican food)</li>

            <li>Bars (Blue Tusk, Empire, Saltine Warrior (catch an SU game), (Awful Als)</li>
          </ul></p>
        
          <p class="question"><b>Q:</b> <i>How does one get settled in at Rounded?</i></p>
          <p><ul class="bullets">
            <li>Look for work</li>
            <li>Find your niche</li>
            <li>Ask questions</li>
            <li>Get coffee with the team!</li>
          </ul></p>

          <p>You're likely a new member of the team because you exemplify the desire to learn and try new things. That said, you'll know better than anyone in what most interests you ... so find a way to do it.</p>
        
          <p class="question"><b>Q:</b> <i>Who do I report to?</i></p>

          <p>We decided long ago that a hierarchy, set policies, and defined structure just aren't us. We believe hierarchy stifles creativity. Instead we have established a flat structure, and all of the employees offer an open door policy. If you have any questions, which you will, just ask.</p>

          <p>Before you begin one of the partners will set you up with someone to shadow, so they can be your point of contact.</p>

          <p>We won't tell you what to do or how to do it, but of course we expect you to get your work done and meet your deadlines.</p>

          <p class="question"><b>Q:</b> <i>How do new employees discover their role?</i></p>

          <p>We brought you on with a relatively defined role. However, if you have any questions about your role or defining that further don't hesitate to speak to a partner. As you will witness, we are an ongoing changing company, which means your roles will change as well. Roles will also change by project, which will be apparent as projects progress.</p> 

          <p>You will likely get bounced around a few times, but that's a good thing. You won't find anyone at Rounded who can't do a bunch of things well.</p>
    
          <p class="question"><b>Q:</b> <i>Are interns, part-time, and full-time employees treated differently?</i></p>

          <p>"Paid differently. Treated the same."</p>
          <p class="name">-Brian Weinreich</p>
        
          <p class="answer">Interns and Part-time employees usually imply a temporary time frame. Interns usually require more hands on involvement, but in general, everyone is expected to meet their deadline and be inline with our values.</p>
       
          <p class="question">
            <b>Q:</b>
            <i>Is there a formal training process for new employees?</i>
          </p>
          <p>"Read this booklet!"</P>
            <p class="name">-Brian Weinreich</p>
          
            <p class="answer">There is no formal training for new employees.</p>
           
            <p class="question"><b>Q:</b> <i>Is there an opportunity to grow in Rounded?</i></p>

            <p>"Effort in the office does not go unnoticed&#8212;one of the benefits of having 6 partners."</p>
            <p class="name">-Rob Grazioli</p>
          
            <p>"Constantly improve your skills and learn new things."</p>
            <p class="name">-Rob Grazioli</p>
           
            <p>Employees that go above and beyond their normal duties on a regular basis, be it by staying late to finish a project, or learning a new skill set, will increase their value, our value, and most likely their pay.</p>

            <p>We are all friends here. When it comes to work we won't hound you but we expect you to meet your deadlines. Of course always be ready and willing to learn.<p>

              <p>As you may know by now we love going out together and attending events.  So come on out and go to as many places people invite you to.</p>
         
              <p class="question"><b>Q:</b> <i>What are Rounded's expectations and goals when hiring?</i></p>

              <p>We want to hire awesome people first and foremost. But of course, we hire people who can communicate well, learn fast, and fit well within our culture. While we certainly have fun around the office, make no mistake, we take what we do very seriously and would only hire people we feel can get the job done.</p>
         
              <p class="question"><b>Q:</b> <i>What are the expectations for communication?</i></p>

              <p>When it comes to communication a great rule of thumb is to speak up! We want to hear what you're doing for the weekend, what you're working on, what you're enjoying or not enjoying. During work hours the office should mostly be quiet. Non-vital communication should go through HipChat, so we can get a hold of you without possibly interrupting your work. Outside of the office, we expect everyone to be available by email (barring any late-night hours and vacations). Communication at Rounded is extremely important. We're a fast moving organization and without great communication we'd crumble.</p>

              <p>Being friends is just as important as being co-workers.  We encourage all of our employees to hang out, play some ping-pong, grab a drink, and attend our group activities. This is what makes Rounded unique and a fun place to work. New employees can always consider Rounded as a second home. The more we know each other the better we'll all be able to work together.</p>
              
              <p class="question"><b>Q:</b> <i>What if I screw up?</i></p>

              <p>"Just hit the backspace button."</p>
              <p class="name">-Brian Weinreich</p>
           
              <p>We encourage risk taking and realize people will make mistakes. If you're open and honest with yourself and communicate your mistake(s) to those affected, you'll quickly grow into a fine person. We all make mistakes, Rounded has made many; it's those that learn from their mistakes that exceed.</p>
           
              <p class="question"><b>Q:</b> <i>Do employees have to count hours?</i></p>

              <p>All employees are expected to use Harvest to keep track of the time they're putting into each project. This is not a tool to monitor how much people are working, it's simply so that we can better manage our time and accurately forecast how long projects will take and how much they should cost. We would like part-time employees to track their hours to determine payment. If you go over your hours email Eric Hinman (<a href="eh@roundedco.com"target="_blank">eh@roundedco.com</a>).<p>

                <p>*Note: lunch is not included in your hours unless it is a lunch meeting.</p>
             
                <p class="question"><b>Q:</b> <i>Are there performance reviews?</i></p>

                <p>We don't have any formal performance reviews. That being said, employees can expect partners to regularly give updates on performance, especially the quality of work that they are producing.</p>

                <p>If you ever have a question as to how you are doing, just ask one of the closest people you work with. Any of the Rounded partners would be happy to sit down and go over your work, and performance.  We promise we won't be keeping a watchful eye on you that's for sure.</p>
            
                <p class="question"><b>Q:</b> <i>What am I expected to wear to work?</i></p>

                <!-- [picture of brian in underwear] -->

                <p>"Shoes, shirt, pants, and underwear."</p>
                <p class="name">-Brian Weinreich</p>
           
                <p>"Anything you want with the exception of belly shirts (applies to men only) and fishnet shirts (unless paired with leather pants)."</p>
                <p class="name">-Eric Hinman</p>

          
                <p class="question"><b>Q:</b> <i>What if I want to take time off or I'm sick?</i></p>

                <p>"Don't come to the office if you're sick. I will personally push you back out the door. Not because I feel bad, but because I don't want to get sick."</p>
                <p class="name">-Brian Weinreich</p>
             
                <p>We do not have set vacation time. We just expect you to get your work done. If you'd like to take an extended vacation, you're expected to give a reasonable notice on Kin HR. Before your leave to allow for the rest of the team to plan around your departure. If you're going to work from home, you're expected to give 24 hour notice to Ben Redfield. If you're not coming into the office on a random day just shoot the partners an email (<a href="partners@roundedco.com" target="_blank">partners@roundedco.com</a>). (Note: If you are part-time please track your hours). Employees should aim for 20 days a year of vacation time.</p> 

                <p>We don't want people to feel bad about taking time off to rest your mind, go to a family reunion, or vacation to one of your favorite destinations. Just do so responsibly.</p>

            <h3>Project Expectations</h3>
                <p class="question"><b>Q:</b> <i>How do employees select projects to work on?</i></p>

                <p>Typically employees will be assigned to projects and teams, based on their role and skill set. However, if there is a project that specifically interests you, never hesitate to make that known!</p>

                <p>If you are looking to learn a new language or skill, you are encouraged to test the waters beforehand, and then put those skills to work to build on a project.</p>

             
                <p class="question"><b>Q:</b> <i>What are the expectations for client/employee relationships?</i>

                  <p>In terms of client relationships, always be professional. We would like you to maintain realistic expectations for both our team and the work that we produce.</p>

            
                  <p class="question"><b>Q:</b> <i>What if I don't want to work on a project anymore?</i></p></p>

                  <p>If you don't want to work on a project anymore, bring it up with the partners. If the work being done is not enjoyed, it's something that we want to address as soon as possible. If there are problems with the internal team or the client associated with the project, it's important that we sort things out.</p>
